/**
 *  ****************  Send IP2IR Parent App  ****************
 *
 *  Design Usage:
 *  This app is designed to send commands to an iTach IP2IR device.
 *
 *  IR Codes can be found using Global Cache Control Tower IR Database, https://irdb.globalcache.com/
 *
 *  Copyright 2018 Bryan Turcotte (@bptworld)
 *
 *  Special thanks to Andrew Parker (@Cobra) for use of his Parent/Child code and various other bits and pieces.
 *  Also thanks to Carson Dallum's (@cdallum) for the original IP2IR driver code that I based mine off of.
 *  
 *  This App is free.  If you like and use this app, please be sure to give a shout out on the Hubitat forums to let
 *  people know that it exists!  Thanks.

 *  Changes:
 *
 *  V1.1.7 - 01/15/19 - Updated footer with update check and links
 *  V1.1.6 - 12/30/18 - Updated to my new color theme.
 *  V1.1.5 - 12/06/18 - Code cleanup, removal of IP Address from Child Apps as it was not needed anymore. 
 *  V1.1.4 - 11/30/18 - Added pause button to child apps. Added an Enable/Disable by switch option. Cleaned up code.
 *  V1.1.3 - 11/02/18 - Added the ability to send multiple Switch On's, Off's or both and Button's to send mutilple times with
 *                      each push. Also Fixed some typo's.
 *  V1.1.2 - 11/01/18 - Added an optional Digit 4 within Channels. Sending Enter Code after Digits is now optional. Made the
 *                      Delay between sending digits user specified and added in some instructions.
 *  V1.1.1 - 10/29/18 - Updated Channels to be either a Button or a Switch, only Switches can be used with Google Assistant.  
 *  V1.1.0 - 10/20/18 - Big change in how Channels work. Only have to enter each digits IR code once, in the Advance Section of
 *			 			the Parent app. Now in the Child apps, only need to put in the digits (no IR codes!). This is a 
 *			 			non-destructive update. All existing channels will still work. Thanks to Bruce (@bravenel) for showing
 *						me how to send code from parent to child apps.
 *  V1.0.0 - 10/15/18 - Initial release
