 *  Changes:
 *
 *  V1.1.0 - 02/24/19 - Cosmetic update.
 *  V1.0.9 - 01/18/19 - Not going to update Parent apps anymore unless there is a change in the Parent app, not just the child.
 *  V1.0.8 - 01/15/19 - Updated footer with update check and links
 *  V1.0.7 - 01/04/19 - Modification by rayzurbock. Report now shows 'battery level isn't reporting' when a device's battery
